    <h1>Big Iron, Marty Robbinson</h1>
    <p>
        To the town of Agua Fria<br>
        Rode a stranger one fine day<br>
        Hardly spoke to folks around him<br>
        Didn't have too much to say<br>
        No one dare to ask his business<br>
        No one dare to make him slip<br>
        The stranger there amoung them<br>
        Had the Big Iron on his hips<br>
        Big Iron on his hips<br><br>

        It was early in the morning<br>
        When he rode into the town<br>
        He came riding from the south side<br>
        Slowly looking all around<br>
        "He's an outlaw loose and running"<br>
        Came the whisper from each lip<br>
        "And he's here to do some business<br>
        With the big iron on his hip"<br>
        Big iron on his hip<br><br>

        In this town there lived an outlaw<br>
        By the name of Texas Red<br>
        Many men had tried to take him<br>
        And that many men were dead<br>
        He was vicious and a killer<br>
        Though a youth of twenty-four<br>
        And the notches on his pistol<br>
        Numbered one and nineteen more<br>
        One and nineteen more<br><br>

        Now the stranger started talking<br>
        Made it plain to folks around<br>
        Was an Arizona Ranger<br>
        Wouldn't be too long in town<br>
        He came here to take an outlaw<br>
        Back alive, or maybe dead<br>
        And he said it didn't matter<br>
        He was after Texas Red<br>
        After Texas Red<br><br>

        Wasn't long before the story<br>
        Was relayed to Texas Red<br>
        But the outlaw didn't worry<br>
        Men that tried before were dead<br>
        Twenty men had tried to take him<br>
        Twenty men had made a slip<br>
        Twenty-one would be the Ranger<br>
        With the big iron on his hip<br>
        Big iron on his hip<br><br>

        The morning passed so quickly<br>
        It was time for them to meet<br>
        It was twenty past eleven<br>
        When they walked out in the street<br>
        Folks were watching from the windows<br>
        Everybody held their breath<br>
        They knew this handsome Ranger<br>
        Was about to meet his death<br>
        'Bout to meet his death<br><br>

        There was forty feet between them<br>
        When they stopped to make their play<br>
        And the swiftness of the Ranger<br>
        Is still talked about today<br>
        Texas Red had not cleared leather<br>
        'Fore a bullet fairly ripped<br>
        And the Ranger's aim was deadly<br>
        With the big iron on his hip<br>
        Big iron on his hip<br><br>

        It was over in a moment<br>
        And the folks had gathered round<br>
        There before them lay the body<br>
        Of the outlaw on the ground<br>
        Oh, he might have went on livin'<br>
        But he made one fatal slip<br>
        When he tried to match the Ranger<br>
        With the big iron on his hip<br>
        Big iron on his hip<br><br>

        Big iron, big iron<br>
        When he tried to match the Ranger<br>
        With the big iron on his hip<br>
        Big iron on his hip<br><br>
