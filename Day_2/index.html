        <div class="verse">
            <div class="stanza">To the town of Agua Fria</div>
            Rode a stranger one fine day<br>
            Hardly spoke to folks around him<br>
            Didn't have too much to say<br>
            No one dare to ask his business<br>
            No one dare to make him slip<br>
            The stranger there amoung them<br>
            Had the Big Iron on his hips<br>
            Big Iron on his hips<br><br>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="stanza"> It was early in the morning</div>
            When he rode into the town<br>
            He came riding from the south side<br>
            Slowly looking all around<br>
            "He's an outlaw loose and running"<br>
            Came the whisper from each lip<br>
            "And he's here to do some business<br>
            With the big iron on his hip"<br>
            Big iron on his hip<br><br>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="stanza">In this town there lived an outlaw</div>
            By the name of Texas Red<br>
            Many men had tried to take him<br>
            And that many men were dead<br>
            He was vicious and a killer<br>
            Though a youth of twenty-four<br>
            And the notches on his pistol<br>
            Numbered one and nineteen more<br>
            One and nineteen more<br><br>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="stanza">Now the stranger started talking</div>
            Made it plain to folks around<br>
            Was an Arizona Ranger<br>
            Wouldn't be too long in town<br>
            He came here to take an outlaw<br>
            Back alive, or maybe dead<br>
            And he said it didn't matter<br>
            He was after Texas Red<br>
            After Texas Red<br><br>    
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="stanza">Wasn't long before the story</div>
            Was relayed to Texas Red<br>
            But the outlaw didn't worry<br>
            Men that tried before were dead<br>
            Twenty men had tried to take him<br>
            Twenty men had made a slip<br>
            Twenty-one would be the Ranger<br>
            With the big iron on his hip<br>
            Big iron on his hip<br><br>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="stanza">The morning passed so quickly</div>
            It was time for them to meet<br>
            It was twenty past eleven<br>
            When they walked out in the street<br>
            Folks were watching from the windows<br>
            Everybody held their breath<br>
            They knew this handsome Ranger<br>
            Was about to meet his death<br>
            'Bout to meet his death<br><br>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="stanza">There was forty feet between them</div>
            When they stopped to make their play<br>
            And the swiftness of the Ranger<br>
            Is still talked about today<br>
            Texas Red had not cleared leather<br>
            'Fore a bullet fairly ripped<br>
            And the Ranger's aim was deadly<br>
            With the big iron on his hip<br>
            Big iron on his hip<br><br>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="stanza">It was over in a moment</div>
            And the folks had gathered round<br>
            There before them lay the body<br>
            Of the outlaw on the ground<br>
            Oh, he might have went on livin'<br>
            But he made one fatal slip<br>
            When he tried to match the Ranger<br>
            With the big iron on his hip<br>
            Big iron on his hip<br><br>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="stanza">Big iron, big iron</div>
            When he tried to match the Ranger<br>
            With the big iron on his hip<br>
            Big iron on his hip<br><br>
